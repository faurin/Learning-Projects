# Learning-Projects
Repository that contains my way of learning Python through the small projects.
It was simply created for me, to see my learning curve and how my skills are improving during the time.
To anybody checking it out, I apprecieate time you will put into it.
Please leave some comment or feedback if you feel like it, or if you see some horrible rookie mistakes :).
